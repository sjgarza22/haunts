## Welcome to HAUNTS
In this README, you will learn how to install and use the HAUNTS application.

## Description
HAUNTS is an app that will allow users to search for haunted/paranormal locations near a location they enter.

## Installation
To install this program, please clone this repository.

This is the FrontEnd of the application ONLY. In order to use this program, you will need to clone the BackEnd repository--which you can find here: [Haunts-API](https://github.com/sjgarza22/haunts-api)--and follow the Readme Installation instructions to get the BackEnd running.

Once you have the BackEnd running, open Index.html on your preferred web browser.

The main page will load with a search bar, enter the location you wish to search for nearby Paranormal locations and the locations will load below.

This webpage will allow you to interact with the application.

## Use

Users will sign up by either manually creating a login or by using one of the third-party OAuth logins.

After signing up/logging in, a user will be redirecting to their Trip Index page. If no trips have been created, they will be prompted to create one.

A trip requires a title that is a minimum of three character's long. A user can also choose to invite other users at this time to join the trip.

When a trip is made an Idea Board is also created. When a user goes to the Idea Board for the first time, if not Ideas have been created they will be prompted to create one.

An Idea is made up of three main attributes: title, about and price. Each of those three items must be filled out, if the price is unknown or if the activity is free a user must enter in zero for the price. Once Ideas have been populated, users can filter the Ideas by a specific user.
